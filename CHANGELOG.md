# Changelog

All notable changes to Shipslip are listed here. Shipslip follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); before 1.0, a minor release may
change the library API.

## [0.1.1] - Unreleased

### Added

- Prebuilt binaries for macOS and Linux and a one-line installer; Rust is no
  longer required to install.
- `slip --version` (or `-V`) prints the installed version.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-01

First usable release. Version 0.0.1 only reserved the crate name.

### Added

- `slip` CLI with `init`, `trust`, `deploy`, `rerun`, `from-step`, `attach`,
  `break-lock`, and `up`.
- `slip init` writes a commented `.shipslip.toml` from a few questions, with
  the default Laravel recipe spelled out.
- Two-phase deploys: read-only preflight shows the exact commits and steps,
  and nothing changes on the server until you confirm. Production runs require
  typing the environment name.
- Preflight requires a clean checkout on the configured branch and a
  fast-forward, and rechecks the server right before the first change.
- Config trust: each environment's settings must be approved with
  `slip trust`, and approved again after they change.
- A deploy lock on the server with a heartbeat. `slip break-lock` shows the
  holder and clears a stale lock after you confirm.
- Steps run detached on the server, so a dropped connection does not stop
  them. `slip attach` resumes an unfinished run without relaunching its step.
- Optional maintenance mode around the steps (`php artisan down`/`up`), and
  `slip up` to bring the app back.
- Local receipts recording the plan, commits, step results, recent output,
  log watch, smoke check, and outcome.
- Post-deploy checks: the Laravel log is watched during the deploy and for
  120 seconds after it, reporting only errors not seen before, and an optional
  smoke URL is requested from your computer.
- Ctrl-C acts on the current stage: it cancels cleanly at the confirmation
  prompt, stops following a running step, or ends the log watch early. A
  second Ctrl-C quits at once.
- A Rust library API (`prepare`, `execute`, `attach`, `DeployEvent`, and
  more) for other front-ends. The library never reads stdin or writes to
  stdout or stderr.

### Requirements

- macOS or Linux with Rust 1.88 or newer, Git, and OpenSSH; `curl` for smoke
  checks.
- A Linux server with bash and a Git checkout that can `git fetch origin`
  without a prompt.
